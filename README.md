# LaunchVehicles

NOTE : Keep all 5 files in one Folder and then run from Spyder preferably
Follow the instructions in the code documentation before running the code

3 Projects on the Launch Vehicle Analysis

GravityTurn.py : Simulated gravity turn trajectories viz. constant pitch, constant velocity and constant Thrust-by-mass trajectories

Lagrangian.py :  Obtained optimal staging solution using lagrangian multiplier based constrained optimization technique

MassFlowRateOptimize.py : Optimized the mass-flow rate of large-scale launch vehicles by minimizing the gravity and drag losses for vertical ascent
